- Added support for particles
- Fixed glint rendering for armor and items
- Added compatibility with other mods and resource packs (Figura, 3D Skins, ETF, EMF, Fresh Animation, etc.)
- Changed options for managing hiding distances (now separate y and xz). This means now you can make a cylinder-like radius!
- Fixed YACL buttons, now it works fine
